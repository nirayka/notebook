    <h1>nira's notebook</h1>

    <p>Hi! Welcome to my summer blog, inspired by my dear friend Tanvi (whose lovely blog you can see
        <a href="https://tanvianand4.github.io/postcards/">here</a>). I don't have any grand plans for this;
        I'll just be posting small updates when I feel like it. The hope is that at the very least, I won't forget
        about this by the end of the summer.

        <br><br>Also, please note that I am writing all the code for this from scratch (no templates), so if
        things are janky, that's why. Sorry.
    </p>
